# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- Scientific approach to software development
- Identifies discreet steps neede to develop software
- Systematic process to develop high quality software
- Aims to produce software that meets requirements
- Defined phases with their own processes and deliverables
- Cycle of planning, design and development
- Minimises development risks and costs              

### Advantages fo SDLC
- improves efficienct and reduces risks
- Team members know what the should be woirking oin and when
- Faciliattes communication among stakelholders
- Team members know when development can move to the next phase
- Respond to changing requirements
- Solve problems early in the process
- Reduces overlapping responsibilties

## Phases of Software development life cycle:

- 6 discrete phases that do not overlap with one another

#### Phase 1 - Planning

- Requirements are:
  1. gathered
  2. Analysed
  3. Documented
  4. Prioritised

- When plannig for a software developemnt the following must be considered:
  1. Users
  2. Resourcing
  3. Purpose of the application
  4. Risk ID
  5. Inputs/outputs
  6. Project scheduling
  7. Compliance
  8. Quality Assurance

- In the plannig phase the following tasks are also completed:
  1. Labor and materials costs are estimated and weighed against time constraints
  2. Project teams are identified and role of each team member are proposed
 
- Prototyping:
  1. Small scale replica to clarify requirements
  2. test design ideas
  3. Can be developed at various stages of teh SDLC
 
- After the requirements have been compiled, they are combined into a Softwaere Requirements Specification (SRS).
- Needs to be approved by all stakeholders

#### Phase 2 -Design

- Requirements are gathered from teh SRS to develop architecture
- Design document is created to develop

#### Phase 3- Development

- Use the design document to develop the application

#### Phase 4 - Testing 

- Code is teste to ensure stabilty, security and taht it meets the requirements from the SRS
- Bugs reported, tracked, fixed and retested
- Unit testing, integration testing, System testing, Acceptance testing

#### Phase 5 - Deployment

- Application is released into production environment
- First released into a UAT testing environment

#### Phase 6 - Maintenance

- Other bugs
- Code enhancements
- USer interface issues
- New and changes to requirements (SRS)
- Stakeholder feedback

#### RECAP OF THE SDLC

1. Planning - Weite the requirements and develop the software requirements specifications (SRS)

2. Design - Document software architecture needs and design the architecture

3. Development - Assign tasks to developers. Write code that powers the software

4. Testing - Test the application to ensure it is stable and meets the requirements

5. Deployment - Prepare teh production environment and delpy the sofware into production

6. Maintenance - Fix bugs reported by users, and make the code enhancements


## Building Quality Software

#### Requirements Gathering

- SRS encompasses the process opf collecting and documenting the set of requirements taht the software needs to adhere to
- It may include a set of use cases that describe teh business needs and user flows taht the software must implement
- Requirements can be categorised into 4 categories:
  1. Functional requirement
  2. External and user interface requirement
  3. System features
  4. Nonfunctional requirements

#### Design

- Transforming requirements into code
- Breaking down requirements into sets of related components
- Communicates business rules and application logic
- Code quality:
  - Clean and consistent
  - Easy to read and maintain
  - efficient

- Following coding standards
- Use linters to find errors
- Commenting on the code

#### Testing 

- Identify errors, gaos ro missing requirements
- Unit testing, integration, system and acceptance
- Unit testing tests the smallest units of the code
- UAT (Also called beta tesing)

#### Deployment Releases

Aplha: 
- First release to select stakeholders
- MAy contain errors
- Preview of the functioning version
- Design changes may occur

Beta:
- All stakeholders
- User testing
- Meets requirements

GA (General Availability):
- Stable
- All users

#### Documenatation:

- System documentation:
  - README files
  - Inline comments
  - architecture and design documents
  - verification informatyion and maintenance information

- User Documentation:
  - User guides
  - Instructional videos
  - manuals
  - online and inline help


## Requirements

The requirements process is a 6 step process that involves:

1. Identifying stakeholders
2. Establishing goals and objectives:
   - Goals internal and external
4. Eliciting requirements from the stakeholders:
   - Sruveys, questionnaires, interviews
6. Documenting the requirements
7. Analysing and confirming the reuqirements
8. Prioritising:
   - Must have
   - Nice to have
   - Dont need

You should get 3 documents arising from the Requriements phase:

1. Software requirements specification (SRS)
   - Captrues functinalities that the software holuld perform
   - Establishes benchamrks/ Service levels for performance
   - Purpose and scorpe of the application
   - Constraints and assumptions, dependencies
     - Constraints - How the software must operate under given conditions
     - Assumptions on what OS it will be built on, etc
     - Dependencies on other softwares
       
3. User requirements specification (URS):
   - Describes business needs and end-user expectations
   - User stories:
     - Who is the user
     - What is the function that needs to be performed
     - Why does the user want this functionality?
   - Confirmed duing the user acceptance
   - Often combined with the SRS
     
5. Systems requirements specification (SysRS)
 - Oulines the requirements for the entire application
 - Borader in scope than the SRS
 - includes:
   - Policy and regulation
   - performance
   - security
   - etc
