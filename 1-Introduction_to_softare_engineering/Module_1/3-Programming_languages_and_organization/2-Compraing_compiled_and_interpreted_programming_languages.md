# Interprete languages

- Create a scrited source code for smaller tasks
- The source code goes through an interpreter.
- The interpreter is built into the operating system on a computer on a web browser.
- Also called scripting as the are used to automate code
- Interpreter programs read and execute the source code line by line
- The source code needs to be executed each time
- Runs in almost any OS with the right interpreter

# Compiled languages

- Are used to create files
- the files are executables files
- They are then grouped in programs that you can run on a computer or a device
- Used for more complex programs taht complete larger tasks
- Larger programs installed on the compiter or device
- longer time to write the code but runs faster
- Grouped into one downloadable file

## Differences

1. Interpreted
   - Avaiable across multiple platforms or in the cloud
   - Easier to learn and use
   - Better for websites and smaller repeated tasks
  
  2. Compiled
  - same operating system coded in the same language
  - More difficult to learn and use
  - Better for larger tasks like an OS


## Programming Language Examples: 

###  C, C++ and C# (C-sharp)

- Compiled programming language
- C is the original language and C++ and C# are variations of C
- Case sensitive language
- Basis for windows and many operating systems
- Takes more time to learn and use for cosing but requires less memory and code runs faster

### Java
- Compile programming language
- Case-sensitive, object-oriented programming langauge
- required Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run the code
- Origramming language for Android OS
  Cross-Platform language that runs the same code on macOS, Windows and Linux (This is because it runs the same code on the JVM which needs to be installed on the plaform that you are running the code on)

  ## Python
  - Interpreted lanaguage
  - Scripting lanaguage
  - General-use, case-sensitive programming language
  - Used with Windows, macOs and inux oeprating systsems and iwth server-side web app code

  ## Javascript
  - Interpreted programming language
  - Scripting language that runs on the client  sidein web browsers
  - Case sensitive
  - Simple scripts are run with HTML
  - Complex scripts are run in seperate files
  - Not to be confused with Java the compiling programming language
 
  ## HTML
  - Interpreted language
  - Case insensitive
  - Uses tags to format pages on clients side in browsers
  -
